I am an undergraduate student in **Reliability and System Engineering(RSE)** with a dual-degree in **Economy** at **Beihang University**.

My research field lies in **Uncertainty Quantification** and my undergraduate professor is Wang Peng, an expert in uncertainty qualification graduated in UCSD**.** After graduation, driven by my academic enthusiasm in math, I plan to pursue graduate study in **Stochastics** or in **Numerical Stochastic Differential Equation(nspde)**. My research interests broadly cover the interdisciplinary fields of Computational Mathematics and Uncertianty Qulification in Stochastic System, currently focusing on the generalized Polynominal Chaos applications of stochastic system with small probability in failure.
