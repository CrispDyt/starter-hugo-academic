**Yiting (Crisp) Duan** is an undergraduate student in **Reliability and System Engineering(RSE)** and  also have a duel-degree in **Economy** at **Beihang University**.

After graduation, he plans to pursue graduate study in **Stochastics** or in **Numerical Stochastics Partial Differential Equation(nspde)**. His research interests broadly cover the interdisciplinary fields of Computational Science and Engineering & Uncertianty Qulification in Stochastic System, currently focusing on the generalized Polynominal Chaos applications of stochastic system with small probability in failure.
