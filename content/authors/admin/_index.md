I am an undergraduate student in grade 4 in **Reliability and System Engineering(RSE)** with a dual degree in **Economy** at **Beihang University**.

My research field lies in **Uncertainty Quantification(UQ)** and my undergraduate professor is Wang Peng, an expert in uncertainty qualification. After graduation, driven by my academic enthusiasm for math, I plan to pursue graduate study in **UQ** or **Applied** **Mathematics**. My research interests broadly cover the interdisciplinary fields of Computational Mathematics and Uncertainty Quantification in Stochastic Systems, currently focusing on the generalized Polynomial Chaos applications of stochastic systems with small probability failure which is my undergraduate dissertation. 

I plan to pursue a Ph.D. study in Engineering or Applied Mathematics. Now I devote myself to **Fault Diagnosis and Detection(FDD)** with probability eyesight, **multi-fidelity model data assimilation framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs),** and **uncertainty quantification problems in PINNs**.
