I am an undergraduate student at grade 4 in **Reliability and System Engineering(RSE)** with a dual-degree in **Economy** at **Beihang University**.

My research field lies in **Uncertainty Quantification(UQ)** and my undergraduate professor is Wang Peng, an expert in uncertainty qualification graduated in UCSD. After graduation, driven by my academic enthusiasm in math, I plan to pursue graduate study in **Stochastics** or in **Numerical Stochastic Differential Equation(nspde)**. My research interests broadly cover the interdisciplinary fields of Computational Mathematics and Uncertianty Qulification in Stochastic System, currently focusing on the generalized Polynominal Chaos applications of stochastic system with small probability in failure which is my undergraduate dissertation.

I plan to devote myself in uncertainty qualification problems in Computational Fluid Mechanics and Turbulence during my graduate study in UM, especially in topics about **UQ Problems** both in **Fluid-Structure Interaction System in Human Blood Vessels** and **Two-Phase** **Flow in Human Blood** or **Porous Media.**
