I am a first-year PhD student at the **Translational Research Institute (THRI) & School of Computer, Data and Mathematical Science (CDMS)** at **Western Sydney University**. I completed my undergraduate studies at **Beihang University (BUAA)**, earning a bachelor's degree in **reliability and systems engineering**, as well as a double degree in **economics**. I then obtained my master's degree in **Mathematics** from the **University of Macau (UM)**, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in **data science** and **epidemiology**. My undergraduate thesis focused on evaluating small failure probabilities using the generalized polynomial chaos model (gPC), and my master's thesis addressed the regime shift of high-frequency limit order book data using deep learning methods with a change-point detection module.    

My research focuses on **Electronic Health Records (EHR) Modeling**, **Manifold Learning** and **Machine Learning**. My principle professor is Yi Guo, an expert in machine learning. My research interests broadly encompass the interdisciplinary fields of nonlinear dynamic systems, including **reservior computing**, **chaotic attractor reconstruction** and **ODE discovery**. I am also involved in **manifold Learning**, specifically **dimensionality reduction**, **manifold clustering** and **kernel joint embedding**, as well as **Neural Spatial-Temporal Point Process (NSTPP)**. Additionally, I am currently a researcher at WentWest, an Australia Primary Health Network institute, where I focus on heterogeneity and multi-model EHR datasets. My previous publications have focused on solving partial differential equations with spatio-temporal varying parameters using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and on an online fast fault detection method.
