Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations\
(PDE), have attracted great attention due to its flexibility and simplicity. We use PINNs method to solve 2D and 3D Possion Equation $$
\Delta u=-\sin (4 \pi x) \sin (4 \pi y),  , (x,y) \in \Omega \
u = \frac{1}{2(4\pi)^2}\sin (4 \pi x) \sin (4 \pi y),  , (x,y) \in \partial\Omega
$$ where $\Omega$ represents the domain of PDE such as rectangleï¼Œtriangular, round and pentagram.
