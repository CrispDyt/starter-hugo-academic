abstract: This paper systematically discusses how the inherent properties of chaotic attractors influence the results
 of discovering causality from time series using convergent cross mapping, particularly how convergent cross
 mapping misleads bidirectional causality as unidirectional when the chaotic attractor exhibits symmetry.
 We propose a novel method based on the k-means clustering method to address the challenges when
 the chaotic attractor exhibits two-fold rotation symmetry. This method is demonstrated to recover the
 symmetry of the latent chaotic attractor and discover the correct causality between time series without
 introducing information from other variables. We validate the accuracy of this method using time series
 derived from low-dimension and high-dimensional chaotic symmetric attractors for which convergent cross
 mapping may conclude erroneous results.
